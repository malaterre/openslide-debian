.RE
.SS "Overview"
.PP
The Hamamatsu format has three variants\&. VMS and VMU consist of an index file, 2 or more image files, and (in the case of VMS) an \(lqoptimisation\(rq file\&. NDPI consists of a single TIFF\-like file with some custom TIFF tags\&. VMS and NDPI contain JPEG images; VMU contains NGR images (a custom uncompressed format)\&.
.PP
Multiple focal planes are ignored, only focal plane 0 is read\&.
.PP
JPEG does not allow for files larger than 65535 pixels on a side\&. In VMS, multiple JPEG files are used to encode large images\&. To avoid having many files, VMS uses close to maximum size (65K by 65K) JPEG files\&. NDPI, instead, stuffs large levels into a single JPEG and sets the overflowed width/height fields to 0\&.
.PP
Unfortunately, JPEG provides very poor support for random\-access decoding of parts of a file\&. To get around this, JPEG restart markers are placed at regular intervals, and these offsets are specified in the optimisation file (in VMS) or in a TIFF tag (in NDPI)\&. With restart markers identified, OpenSlide can treat JPEG as a tiled format, where the height is the height of an MCU row, and the width is the number of MCUs per row divided by the restart marker interval times the width of an MCU\&. (This often leads to oddly\-shaped and inefficient tiles of 4096x8, for example\&.)
.PP
Unfortunately, the VMS optimisation file does not give the location of every restart marker, only the ones found at the beginning of an MCU row\&. It also seems that the file ends early, and does not give the location of the restart marker at the last MCU row of the last image file\&.
.PP
Thus, the optimisation file can only be taken as a hint, and cannot be trusted\&. The entire set of JPEG files must be scanned for restart markers in order to facilitate random access\&. OpenSlide does this lazily as needed, and also in a background thread that runs only when OpenSlide is otherwise idle\&.
.PP
The VMS map file is a lower\-resolution version of the other images, and can be used to make a 2\-level JPEG pyramid\&. JPEG also allows for lower\-resolution decoding, so further pyramid levels are synthesized from each JPEG file\&.
.SS "VMS File"
.PP
The
\&.vms
file is the main index file for the VMS format\&. It is a Windows INI\-style key\-value pair file, with sections\&. Only keys in the
Virtual Microscope Specimen
group are read by OpenSlide\&.

.SS "NDPI File"
.PP
NDPI uses a TIFF\-like structure, but libtiff cannot read the headers of an NDPI file\&. This is because NDPI specifies the
RowsPerStrip
as the height of the file, and after doing out the multiplication, this typically overflows libtiff and it refuses to open the file\&. Also, the TIFF tags are not stored in sorted order\&.
.PP
NDPI stores an image pyramid in TIFF directory entries\&. In some files, the lower\-resolution pyramid levels contain no restart markers\&. The macro image, and sometimes an active\-region map, seems to come last\&.
.PP
JPEG files in NDPI are not necessarily valid\&. If
ImageWidth
or
ImageHeight
exceeds the JPEG limit of 65535, then the width or height as stored in the JPEG file is 0\&. libjpeg will refuse to read the header of such a file, so the JPEG data stream must be altered when fed into libjpeg\&.

The optimisation file contains a list of 32\- (or 64\- or 320\- ?) bit little endian values, giving the file offset into an MCU row, each offset starts at a 40\-byte alignment, and the last row (of the entire file, not each image) seems to be missing\&. The offsets are all packed into 1 file, even with multiple images\&. The order of images is left\-to\-right, top\-to\-bottom\&.
.SS "Map File (only for VMS/VMU)"
.PP
The VMS map file is a standard JPEG file\&. Its restart markers (if any) are not included in the optimisation file\&. The VMU map file is in NGR format\&. This file can be used to provide a lower\-resolution view of the slide\&.
.SS "Image Files (only for VMS/VMU)"

These files are given by the VMS/VMU
ImageFile
keys\&. They are assumed to have a height which is a multiple of the MCU height\&. They are assumed to have a width which is a multiple of MCUs per row divided by the restart interval\&.
.PP
For VMS, these files are in JPEG, for VMU they are in NGR format\&.
.SS "NGR Format"
.PP
The NGR file contains uncompressed 16\-bit RGB data, with a small header\&. The files we have encountered start with
GN, two more bytes, and then width, height, and column width in little endian 32\-bit format\&. The column width must divide evenly into the width\&. Column width is important, since NGR files are generated in columns, where the first column comes first in the file, followed by subsequent files\&. Columns are painted left\-to\-right\&.
.PP
At offset 24 is another 32\-bit integer which gives the offset in the file to the start of the image data\&. The image data we have encountered is in 16\-bit little endian format\&.

The first image in an SVS file is always the baseline image (full resolution)\&. This image is always tiled, usually with a tile size of 240x240 pixels\&. The second image is always a thumbnail, typically with dimensions of about 1024x768 pixels\&. Unlike the other slide images, the thumbnail image is always stripped\&. Following the thumbnail there may be one or more intermediate \(lqpyramid\(rq images\&. These are always compressed with the same type of compression as the baseline image, and have a tiled organization with the same tile size\&.
.PP
Optionally at the end of an SVS file there may be a slide label image, which is a low resolution picture taken of the slide\(cqs label, and/or a macro camera image, which is a low resolution picture taken of the entire slide\&. The label and macro images are always stripped\&.
.SS "JPEG 2000 (compression types 33003 or 33005)"

Some Aperio files use compression type 33003 or 33005\&. Images using this compression need to be decoded as a JPEG 2000 codestream\&. For 33003: YCbCr format, possibly with a chroma subsampling of 4:2:2\&. For 33005: RGB format\&. Note that the TIFF file may not encode the colorspace or subsampling parameters in the
PhotometricInterpretation

.SS "Overview"
.PP
MIRAX can store slides in JPEG, PNG, or BMP formats\&. Because JPEG does not allow for large images, and JPEG and PNG provide very poor support for random\-access decoding of part of an image, multiple images are needed to encode a slide\&. To avoid having many individual files, MIRAX packs these images into a small number of data files\&. The index file provides offsets into the data files for each required piece of data\&.
.PP
The camera on MIRAX scanners takes overlapping photos and records the position of each one\&. Each photo is then split into multiple images which do not overlap\&. Overlaps only occur between images that come from different photos\&.
.PP
To generate level
n + 1, each image from level
n
is downsampled by 2 and then concatenated into a new image, 4 old images per new image (2 x 2)\&. This process is repeated for each level, irrespective of image overlaps\&. Therefore, at sufficiently high levels, a single image can contain one or more embedded overlaps of non\-integral width\&.
.SS "Index File"
.PP
The index file starts with a five\-character ASCII version string, followed by the
SLIDE_ID
from the slidedat file\&. The rest of the file consists of 32\-bit little\-endian integers (unaligned), which can be data values or pointers to byte offsets within the index file\&.
.PP
The first two integers point to offset tables for the hierarchical and nonhierarchical roots, respectively\&. These tables contain one record for each
VAL
in the
HIERARCHICAL
slidedat section\&. For example, the record for
NONHIER_1_VAL_2
would be stored at
nonhier_root + 4 * (NONHIER_0_COUNT + 2)\&.
.PP
Each record is a pointer to a linked list of data pages\&. The first two values in a data page are the number of data items in the page and a pointer to the next page\&. The first page always has 0 data items, and the last page has a 0 next pointer\&.
.PP
There is one hierarchical record for each zoom level\&. The record contains data items consisting of an image index, offset and length within a file, and a file number\&. The file number can be converted to a data file name via the
DATAFILE
slidedat section\&. The image index is equal to
image_y * GENERAL\&.IMAGENUMBER_X + image_x\&. Image coordinates which are not multiples of the zoom level\(cqs downsample factor are omitted\&.
.PP
Nonhierarchical records refer to associated images and additional metadata\&. Nonhierarchical data items consist of three zero values followed by an offset, length, and file number as in hierarchical records\&.
.SS "Data Files"
.PP
A data file begins with a header containing a five\-character ASCII version string, the
SLIDE_ID
from the slidedat file, the file number encoded into three ASCII characters, and 256 bytes of padding\&. The remainder of the file contains packed data referenced by the index file\&.
.SS "Slide Position File"
.PP
The slide position file is referenced by the
VIMSLIDE_POSITION_BUFFER\&.default
nonhierarchical section\&. It contains one entry for each camera position (not each image position) in row\-major order\&. Each entry is nine bytes: a flag byte, the
X
pixel coordinate of the photo (4 bytes, little\-endian, may be negative), and the
Y
coordinate (4 bytes, little\-endian, may be negative)\&. In slides with
CURRENT_SLIDE_VERSION
≥ 1\&.9, the flag byte is 1 if the slide file contains images for this camera position, 0 otherwise\&. In older slides, the flag byte is always 0\&.
.PP
In slides with
CURRENT_SLIDE_VERSION
≥ 2\&.2, the slide position file is compressed with DEFLATE and referenced by the
StitchingIntensityLayer\&.StitchingIntensityLevel
nonhierarchical section\&.
